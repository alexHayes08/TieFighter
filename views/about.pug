                    A blast to the past with a new version of the "Star Wars TIE-Fighter"
                    game. Written 100% javascript, you can now run this classic game
                    on any modern web-browser! Prefer a controller? Great news! This 
                    remake is fully compatible with controllers. The game takes place 
                    inbetween Star Wars episode V - VI. Start off as a rookie TIE-Fighter
                    pilot patrolling the galaxy for pirates and smugglers and work your
                    way up to piloting the infamous TIE-Defender flying alongside the
                    801st and Darth Vader himself! Long live the Empire!
                p.indented.
                    Upcoming: Stay tuned for the sequel game TIE-Predator "Fall of a
                    Republic"

                    | This started out as a small project originally written using 
                    a(href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank") Three.js 
                    | to create a simple flight simulator (with Tie-Fighters)
                    | and I got up to the point where I could fly ships around. 
                    | However I got tired of (attempting to) writing the code
                    | for collision detection, mapping keyboard/touch/other inputs 
                    | to controls, and other non-game logic related code. Then 
                    | I discovered an awesome WebGL framework from Microsoft 
                    | specifically designed for this sort of project, 
                    a(href="https://www.babylonjs.com/" target="_blank") Babylon.js
                    | . This is a beautiful framework that handles most (if not
                    | all) of the game engine logic (thank god) and allows me to 
                    | focus on the game logic. The scope of the project has 
                    | also drastically changed. The new goal of the project 
                    | is to create an almost perfect clone of the old 
                    | Tie-Fighter game (yes that will include all of the DLC) 
                    | and then using that create a new game Tie-Predator which 
                    | will be set in the expanded universe (which is now no 
                    | longer canon) "Star Wars: Legacy"
                    | comic books. However that game is waaay in the future 
                    | and is something to look forward too. The current 
                    | 'deadline' for phase I of the Tie-Fighter game is 
                    | January 1st, 2018. Mark the date! By that day the
                    | basic flight/battle mechanics should be done or at the 
                    | very least playable.

                    This battle station is not fully operational :(
                p.indented.
                    Not even partly.
                    I'm still learning Babylon.js and porting over bits and 
                    pieces of the old project to the new framework. It's gonna 
                    be a while before any of us will be blasting rebel scum in 
                    the name of the empire.

                    | Running this application isn't free and I don't really 
                    | feel all that inclined to pay for everything out of my own 
                    | pocket, hence ads. Also if you notice at 
                    | times there are more ads than usual that means that the 
                    | funds raised have fallen behind. Also I should point out 
                    | that none of the profits go to me. All funds raised are 
                    | only for keeping the server running. If by chance the funds
                    | raised have paid the monthly rent early, ads will be 
                    | disabled.
